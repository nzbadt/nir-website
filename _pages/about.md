Hello! My name is Nir, I'm an experimental geophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania (in Philadelphia), where I'm a postdoctoral fellow. I hold a an BSc and MSc in Geology and Environmental Sciences from Ben-Gurion University (Israel), and a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Brown Univeristy. 

My main research focus is on rock friction which is fundamental for our understanding of how earthquakes initiate, grow and arrest. In addition I also study the deformation of minerals at the microscale, exploring the micromechanical controls on anelastic and plastic deformation. I always look to learn more and so I'm involved in numerous projects, from ice rheology to the mechanical behavior of teeth. Check out my ongoing research projects below!

The role of interfacial bonding on rock and mineral friction
======
During my postdoc I have started working on exploring the role of interfacial bonding on rock and mineral friction. I use a state-of-the-art dual-axis nanoindenter (housed at Texas A&M University) to probe the microphysics of single-asperity frictional contacts. These contacts are of similar scale (in terms of stress and physical dimensions) to those found in natural seismogenic faults. [In this paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105471) we show that fricitonal aging (the increase of frictional strength of a conatct) in quartz is not explicitly dependent on contact area (or time), in stark contradiction to previously interpreted data in rock mechanics. The inert nature of the diamond-quartz (SiO2) contact means that interfacial bonding between the two species is limited and does not contribute to the fricitonal response of the contact. We expect quartz-on-quartz contacts to form siloxane bridging bonds (Si-O-Si) acrosss an interface, which may contribute (or control) the frictional response of this type of contact. This result is a first step towards new experiments of like-on-like contacts at this scale.

In this plot you can see that diamond-quartz contacts do not how the same (seemingly) time-dependent frictional aging behavior as quartz-quarzt contacts. 


Intra-crystal viscoelasticity
======
The viscoelastic response of Earth materials is tied to interesting phenomena, such as seismic wave attenuation, post-glacial rebound and tidal dissipation of planetary bodies. Experimentalists typically quantify a material's viscoelastic behavior through forced oscillations, where the sample is subjected to harmonic forcing which results in a dynamic response of the material. If there's a time lag between the forcing and the resultant strain, then the material behaves as a viscoelastic solid. These experiments require high temperature and confining pressure conditions to activate viscoelastic behavior in rocks and minerals, and so few data exists. I show that by adapting forced oscillations to the nanoindenter a viscoelasticity can be easily and accurately quantified for soft materials such as halite and PMMA, and also for hard materials like olivine and quartz over long time-periods.

This plot shows the forced oscillation method from the naoindenter on a single-crystal of olivine with an oscillation period of 300 seconds.

Check out the pre-prints of two papers related to this project [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14707) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03533). Both papers have been submitted to [Earth and Space Science](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23335084).


Mechanical quantification of mice teeth - model for studying TBCK syndrome
======
TBCK syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by genetic mutations usually carried by both parents. TBCK affects multiple systems in the body making it hard to identify and most children with this syndrome show development delay. Weakening of the bones (osteopenia) is prevalent resulting in slow or degenerate tooth enamel mineralization (fluoroapatite). I'm collaborating with Dr. Kei Katsura from the Penn Dental School and graduate student (Materials Science at Penn) Tracy Jiang on this project where we quantify the mechanical difference between the mice model's teeth (incisors and molars) and jaw bones, and compare models with and without TBCK using nanoindentation. Our recent results show that the elastic modulus of healthy incisors is ~3 times greater than affected ones. We're still gathering data and soon start to write two papers on our findings.

Here's an example of a mouse's jawbone (mandible) showing the incisor, the red boxed area is where indentation has been perfomed (inset) on dentin and enamel.

Studying the effects of fault roughness on earthquake rupture with thermal pressurization
======
This project is a collaboration with [Dr. Yuval Tal](https://ben-gurion.theopenscholar.com/yuval-tal) from Ben-Gurion University. We explore the combined effects of dynamic frictional weakening by thermal pressurization with realistic fault roughness geometries. We're in the final stages of writing a manuscript based on our findings that will be submitted to JGR: Solid Earth soon! In the meantime you can find a snippet of that work in the figure below.
![TP_roughness](https://github.com/nzbadt/nzbadt.github.io/blob/master/TP_roughness.png)
In this figure you can see the three different roughness levels considered here (a): perfectly smooth $b_r = 0$; rough $b_r = 0.004$; and very rough $b_r = 0.008$. The calculated effective normal stress (b) and temperature along the fault (c) show that both are highly heterogenous and that temperatures can exceed the melting point of typical crustal rock ($~800 ^{\circ}C$, even when thermal pressurization is highly effective.
