Hello! My name is Nir, I'm an experimental geophysicsit at the University of Pennsylvania (in Philadelphia), where I'm a postdoctoral fellow. I hold a an BSc and MSc in Geology and Environmental Sciences from Ben-Gurion University (Israel), and a PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Brown Univeristy (US). My main research focus is on rock friction and deformation, in relation to earthquakes. I always look to learn more and so I'm involved in numerous projects. Check out my ongoing and recent studies below! 

The role of interfacial bonding on rock and mineral friction
======
During my postdoc I have started working on exploring the role of interfacial bonding on rock and mineral friction. I use a state-of-the-art dual-axis nanoindenter (housed at Texas A&M University) to probe the microphysics of single-asperity frictional contacts. These contacts are of similar scale (in terms of stress and physical dimensions) to those found in natural seismogenic faults. [In this paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105471) we show that fricitonal aging (the increase of frictional strength of a conatct) in quartz is not explicitly dependent on contact area (or time), in stark contradiction to previously interpreted data in rock mechanics. The inert nature of the diamond-quartz (SiO2) contact means that interfacial bonding between the two species is limited and does not contribute to the fricitonal response of the contact. We expect quartz-on-quartz contacts to form siloxane bridging bonds (Si-O-Si) acrosss an interface, which may contribute (or control) the frictional response of this type of contact. This result is a first step towards new experiments of like-on-like contacts at this scale.

Intra-crystal viscoelasticity
======
The viscoelastic response of Earth materials is tied to interesting phenomena, such as seismic wave attenuation, post-glacial rebound and tidal dissipation of planetary bodies.
